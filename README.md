# Remote-HMI
This project involves the development of an operator interface program equipped with a TFT screen and a matrix keypad. The primary objective of the program is to establish seamless communication between the ESP32 modules of the multiparallel system and the operator interface. This communication framework enables efficient configuration and real-time monitoring of crucial parameters such as temperature and agitation speed within the multiparallel system. All interactions are facilitated through an intuitive menu system.

# Features
User-Friendly Interface: The TFT screen and matrix keypad provide a user-friendly experience for configuring and monitoring the multiparallel system.

ESP32 Integration: The program seamlessly interfaces with the ESP32 modules, enabling robust communication for precise control.

Parameter Control: Effortlessly adjust and fine-tune temperature and agitation speed settings to suit your experimental needs.

Real-time Monitoring: Stay informed with real-time updates on the multiparallel system's operational status.
